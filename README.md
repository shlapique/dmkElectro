## naive script to download "protected" files from online uni library 

on source site there're a couple of problems:
*(because of a crooked web site programmer)*
* some books are displayed incorrectly 
* the book should be published no later than 2019-2020, due to change in page structure (for "parsing")

### required dependencies
'''
sudo zypper install imagemagick 
'''
*on most distros may already be installed by default*
